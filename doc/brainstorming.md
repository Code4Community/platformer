# Platform Game Brainstorming

## Lesson Plan:

+ Imperative Programming Concepts
+ Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
+ Functional Programming Concepts

## References and Other Programming Games

    Normal Gameplay interspersed with “Programming”

    Gameplay mainly through programming

    graphical functional programming. ClojureScript. I think lisps are good for
    children. Almost no syntax.

## Game Types:

### Category 1: Interact with Code at Beginning of Level

Changing environment of Game

Changing character

Changing level

### Sample Plan for Imperative Programming

+ Part 1: Sequences
  + Level 1: Move the character with a single command.
  + Level 2: Move the character with multiple commands.
  + Level 3: Jump over holes or onto platforms with a jump command.
  + ...
+ Part 2: Conditionals
  + Level 4: Use conditional to act on a randomly changing aspect of the level
  + ...
+ Part 3: Loops
  + Level 5: Use a loop
+ Part 4: Combining concepts + Functions

### Category 2: Interact with code during normal gameplay

Switching Between Mario and Programming – Thinking of Quadrilateral Cowboy

Possible Interfaces:

-   Control normally with arrow keys. Modify objects with right-click
-   Move until obstacle. Drop down appears. Choose action or modify object with
    dropdown.

### Sample Plan for Object-Oriented Programming

+ Part 1: Objects and Properties
  + Level 1: Move the character through a level normally
  + Level 2: Move the character up until a there's a gap in the level. Interact
    with a platform and make it longer.
  + Level 3: Move the character up until some puzzle. Solve the problem by
    modifying object properties.
  + ...
+ Part 2: Calling Methods
  + Level 4: Make some object do something by calling its method.
  + ...
+ Part 3: Inheritance
  + Level 5: Apply rule to abstract class, affecting all enemies?
  + Level 6: Make new kind of object inheriting from another. Like make a new
    power-up inheriting from a power-up class to modify the player in a new way.
  + ...

## Game Elements:

Modify Power-Up Behavior with Code. Change positive increment to decrement.
Monsters coming at player. Modify level with code to avoid monsters
Lives and Levels
Vertical or Horizontal Level
