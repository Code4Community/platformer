# Game Mechanics

This document contains the current iteration of the platformer game.

## Current Idea
- There will be two windows to the game: a code editor and a phaser box.
### Code Editor
- This will be a CodeMirror editor with syntax highlighting, auto formatting, error checking, etc.
- Most of this can just be ported over form Buckeye Catcher.  We can most likely reform this code a bit.
- There will be action listers


## Open Questions
- What will our theme be?
    - What will the sprite be?
    - What will the background be?
    - What will the name of the game be?
- What are some other ideas for the obstacles/mini-games?

## Level Ideas
The Puzzle:

The player needs to move through a door, which is opened when a button is pressed. The button is in a location not accessible to the player, but accessible to a smaller creature (maybe a monster). A nearby monster isn't doing anything and is a re-programmable element, so the player can change the monster's behavior.
    
The Solution:

The player changes the monster's behavior so that it moves through the section of the level that the player can't access, and then it presses the button. Maybe its like a maze that the monster has to move through based on certain conditions. Once the monster reaches and presses the button, the player can move through the door and beat the level.
